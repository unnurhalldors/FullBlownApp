### What you can do

- See list of all available concerts
- When located at Home or Favourites, you can swipe to the left on each concert to favourite/unfavourite
- Search for a specific concert
- See the location of all the concerts on a map
- See details on each concert where you can share the concert, e.g. to _Facebook_, and also favourite/unfavourite
- Navigate from details to _midi.is_ where you can buy a ticket to the selected concert
- The app also includes local storage so your favourites will still be in place when you open the app again!

### What you need

- Expo client `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Expo mobile app/iOS simulator (preferably **iPhone 8 Plus**)

### How to run the app

- To run the app enter `expo start --tunnel` in terminal
- The Map and Share features work better on a mobile than on a simulator. Hence:
  - Use the QR code to open the app on your mobile
- Note that the app was developed on **macOS** and the the simulator/device used was **iPhone 8 Plus**

### Implementation inspirations

- Questions and answers from students and teachers at Piazza
- Guidance from TA's and teachers in lab-classes
- Class material (slides, lectures and such)

### Other information

- Team-members used GitHub and Git to host and manage the code
- Team-members used the .eslintrc.json that was provided for Assignment I
- Team-members decided that all tab titles, headers and such should be in English - but concert titles, locations and dates in Icelandic.
- The app has been published and you can use `https://expo.io/@hkh95/assignmentIV` to access it. This only works for Andorid due to restrictions imposed by apple.
